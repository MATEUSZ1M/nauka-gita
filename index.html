            <p>Finished with my woman 'cause she
            Couldn't help me with my mind
            People think I'm insane because
            I am frowning all the time
        </p>
        <p>All day long I think of things but
            Nothing seems to satisfy
            Think I'll lose my mind if I
            Don't find something to pacify
        </p>
        <p>Can you help me
            Occup up my brain?
            Oh yeah
        </p>
        <p>I need someone to show me the
            Things in life that I can't find
            I can't see the things that make true
            Happiness I must be blind
        </p>
        <p>Make a joke and I will sigh and
            You will laugh and I will cry
            Happiness I cannot feel and
            Love to me is so unreal
        </p>
        <p>And so as you hear these words
            Telling you now of my state
            I tell you to enjoy life
            I wish I could but it's too late
